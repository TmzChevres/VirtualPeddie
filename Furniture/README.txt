For adding new objs:
pull before doing ANYTHING, ALWAYS push when you finish
The folder "CommonObj" is for objects that are really good, ones we will definitely use. They should be
	1.Something that is a standard object that can be used for Every Dorm. 
	eg. desk, chair, drawer. 		
	Can't be some random chair or desk.
	For this, put it into "CommonObj_Universal".
	2.Something that can fit every dorm, but it doesn't have to appear in every dorm.
	eg. PC set, slippers, paintings
	We will put some for some dorms, others for others.
	For this put into "CommonObj_AddOn"
The folder "Furniture Usable" contains everything we will potentially use.
	Add everything that could be of use into this folder, sort it by folders.
	We won't use funny. It's just there.
	Name everything you add.
Sources to find Furniture
	Search on web for databases/libaries. Good ones (add more): Grabcad, cgtrader. Use this to 	search for something general.
	This is more helpful for more specific furnitures, which we really need. Go through a furniture 		libary containg 4,000 files, delete ones unneeded, save anything that could be of use.
		Talk to Bao or Ray for the libary
		For now,
		Ray is sorting: everything staring from 0 to 10
		Bao is sorting: everything after 10
